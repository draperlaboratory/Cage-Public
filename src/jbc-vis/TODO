We aren't drawing contained classes in any useful way.  That is, when another
class is defined within the scope of some outter class, like a private action
listener for a button or something.  That's probably useful information to have,
and we don't render it.

public, private, protected, and static properties are tracked, but not rendered
in any meaningful way.

implicit inheritances (e.g. java.lang.object) aren't tracked or rendered. Maybe
they should be.

Interfaces are ingested, but not rendered any differently than classes
