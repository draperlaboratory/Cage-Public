Challenge Program:

    pwcheck.jar

Challenge Question:

    Does the Challenge Program contain any vulnerability that would allow
    for the password stored in the password file to be extracted (without 
    directly looking at the password file) solely by measuring the time 
    response of repeated queries to the the pwcheck program?  

Additional background for question:

    It may be assumed that the secret contained within the password file
    consists of a password of 5..30 UTF-8 encoded UNICODE charactes from following subset:
    [a..z|A..Z|0..9]

Available Operations:

    Passive Observations: None
    Active Interactions:  Run Challenge Program once (1)

Operational Budget:

    Max number of operations : 10000
    Probability of success   : 99%
