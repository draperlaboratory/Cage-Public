Store Key Value Service Function
================================

This is a very simple service that provides a command line interface to store and retrieve key value pairs.  In order to be efficient, this service uses a hash function.  Though the number of buckets is configurable via an input parameter, typical usage fixes this value to 65536.

The Challenge Program is executed as follows:

    $ java -jar store_key_value.jar 65536 < <input file>
    (see ./example/example.sh)

The arguments are as follows:

1.  Number of buckets in the hash function

2. <input file>; contains a list of commands that the program will run in sequence (after which program exits)

The application is launched using the static integer input 65536 (for the number of buckets in the hash function) and an <input file> argument. The application will then run the commands contained in the input file in sequential order and exit.

The following commands are allowed in the input file:

  put <key> <value>             Sets table[<key>] to <value>.
  get <key>             	Get the value for the specified key.
