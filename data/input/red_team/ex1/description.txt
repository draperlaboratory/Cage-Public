Challenge program is executed as follows:

    $ java -jar /home/challenge_program/encrypt_header.jar send <header file> "<request content>"
    (see ./example/example.sh)

Application concatenates a plaintext <header file> not accessible by user with user 
supplied <request content>; from which an encrypted file is generated. 
The arguments are as follows:

1. The static string `send`.

2. Content of <header file>; typically containing HTTP headers and other parts of the request over
   which the attacker has little or no control.

3. Additional <request content> string data

The program will output a file named <header file>.enc
